    "# 1. What is regression analysis?\n",
    "# Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps in predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Explain the difference between linear and nonlinear regression.\n",
    "# Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, meaning the relationship can be represented by a straight line. Nonlinear regression, on the other hand, models the relationship using a nonlinear function, allowing for more complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?\n",
    "# Simple linear regression involves one independent variable to predict the dependent variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. How is the performance of a regression model typically evaluated?\n",
    "# The performance of a regression model is typically evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. What is overfitting in the context of regression models?\n",
    "# Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the model's performance on new data. This typically happens when the model is too complex.\n",
    "\n",
